## For Students

The remainder of this README is yours to complete. Take this opportunity to describe your
contributions, the design decisions you've made, and any other information you deem necessary.

I implemented the Double Dispatch in the reward's methods, one to give the rewards to the units when the battle 
ends. And a partial Double Dispatch in the battle's methods, this decision was taken because the battle sequence
depends on the player decision to defend or evade the attack, so teh idea is to complete the attack sequence in the 
future.
